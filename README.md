Week 6 P2P - Integrate the Project in to a new React Project

Fork and create your react project cloned from the bootstrap project, Build and locally run the bootstrap
application, create a page having a subscription form and which will also show the submitted data after
submitting it

Create the new project by forking the old one
● Make sure it is able to run locally
● Add the new subscription form that takes input from users

Version Control: Understand the process of forking a repository on a version control platform
● Gain proficiency in building React applications from existing code and in modifying
● Learn how to run a web application locally for testing and development purposes.
● Learn how to handle form submission events in React.
● Learn how to create a responsive and interactive user interface with React.

Instructions:
● Make a copy on GitHub of your existing bootstrap project (forking), and set up a new React project
using the copied code as a starting point
● Modify and enhance the copied project as needed and test that it works on your computer (locally)
to ensure they work as intended
● Create a new webpage within your React project, on this webpage, include a subscription form (for
example like a customer Email-newsletter sign up form) that users can fill out
● When a user submits the subscription form, capture and display the submitted data on the same
page.
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
